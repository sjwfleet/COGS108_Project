    "Reddit was considered a good community for us to hone in on for our topic not just because of its size, but also because it has a dedicated system for us to more easily scrape semi-structured data from the site. We are able to do this with the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW). For the past few days the subreddit r/WallStreetBets has been the center of the trading world with its short squeeze of the Gamestock (GME), AMC Theaters (AMC), and BlackBerry (BB) stocks and more. Their history of trading in a reckless manner goes back much further than just the past few weeks. In this project we look at the trading done in the months leading up to and during the Covid-19 pandemic and how it correlates to several stocks including the S&P 500, TSLA, GME, and more."

    "Keith Gill, also know as the Roaring Kitty on Reddit, Tik Tok, and Youtube, invested $53,000 into GameStop (3). Recently he and his followers invested into GameStop against hedge funds and went against Wall Street norms. He and his fellow investors drove up the price of GameStop, which is still climbing to this day (4). Because Gill's base was mainly on Reddit, we were curious if there was any correlation with the positivity of the subreddit he frequented and the S&P 500. We did some research to see if scraping data from reddit was possible, and according to (2), it would be quite simple to create our own dataset using Reddit's API. We also looked into Kaggle, to see what our ideal dataset would look like (1). Using these resources, we feel confident in our ability to webscrape our own Reddit dataset. We also looked into downloading a dataset from websites that have the history and time periods of stocks. Yahoo Finance provides an easy way to download a dataset with the variables we need in .csv format (4).\n",

    "There is a potential bias in how we webscrape the Reddit API. This bias may come from how we build our dataset from Reddit, as just selecting certain threads might influence our dataset. Another bias could come from the culture of Reddit, in which some threads have certain patterns and trends in commenting and posting. However, we do not have biases coming from our group. We are not involved at all with Reddit, and therefore do not present a bias personally. However, if we gravitate to webscraping certain threads, then we may introduce a bias. We will try to detect these by going through reddit threads we are webscraping, and making sure all of them are not those that we are familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy is another problem. While Reddit data is public property, there are IDs and usernames involved. It is extremely easy to look up reddit usernames, posts, and comments to find the particular post on reddit. We are looking into deanonymizing the data by removing names, usernames, ids, posts, and titles. We are hoping to only publish our sentiment analysis rather than our dataset to prevent people from looking up posts and usernames. If not, this will be problematic as people can look up these posts and target specific users."
