This dataset before cleaning is already very clean. We just need to remove certain columns in order to get what we need to answer our research question. Therefore, we will just need the date and the closing price of the S&P 500. We do not need the adjusted close due to that we are working with the S&P 500 and don't need to work with out of hours like we would with an individual stock or the the opening price since it will just be the previous day's closing price. Since we are only considering the performance of the S&P 500, we do not need the volume."

We wanted a time period that would span from when the subreddit was created (January 31, 2012) to the present. Our dataset, when first webscraped, had many unnecessary columns. Considering how our research question only asks about the positivity of the subreddit, columns such as 'subreddit', and 'event_is_live' are unneeded. We will be focusing on the following columns: body, author_fullname, title, url, total_awards_received, upvote_ratio, category, and created_utc. Some columns are associated with Reddit features that do not pertain to our research question. We also further cleaned our dataset by renaming some columns for better understanding. Such columns include changing the name from author_fullname to Author ID, and title to Post Title. We avoided removing too many columns right now in the case we find that some of the other columns become relevant later on in our data exploration process."
